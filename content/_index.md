> "All artists search. I search for stories, in this post-self age.  What happens when you can no longer call yourself an individual, when  you have split your sense of self among several instances? How do you  react? Do you withdraw into yourself, become a hermit? Do you expand  until you lose all sense of identity? Do you fragment? Do you go about  it deliberately, or do you let nature and chance take their course?"

With  immersive technology at its peak, it's all too easy to get lost. When  RJ loses emself in that virtual world, not only must ey find eir way  out, but find all the answers ey can along the way.

And, nearly a century on, society still struggles with the ramifications of those answers.

## Read what people are saying about *Qoheleth*

> Lack of sleep may have contributed, but I ended up thoroughly in tears at one point. Funny way to say I enjoyed something, perhaps, but there we are . . . I really enjoyed the blend of sci-fi, furry, and everyday queerness.

> . . . an excellent use of the medium, and a real curiosity and insight about how people live their lives and how people will change as technology does.

--- [Payson R. Harris](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3603316723?book_show_action=true)

> Madison finds a way to address not only the joys and terrors of integrated simulation technology, but also tackles questions of gender and identity while telling a pretty gripping mystery story in the process.

> An extra queer alternative to Rainbows End by  Vernor Vinge. A must read if you're into that transhumanism post-scarcity juice.
